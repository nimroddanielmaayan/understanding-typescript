# Understanding Typescript

## Course Sections

### Section 1 - Intro

- This project is based on the Udemy course `Understanding Typescript`

- `Typescript` is never executed directly. Only `Javascript` is executed, so
  `Typescript` must be compiled to `Javascript` to be executed

- `Typescript` doesn't have any effect in the runtime - only in development

- The console command to compile `Typescript` to `Javascript` is `tsc`. For
  example:

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

- `lite-server` is a basic npm package for developing TS projects. It features
  automatic reloading of the browser when a file is changed

### Section 2 - Basics

- `Typescript` has core types and also custom (user-defined) types

- Core types include:

  - `number` (includes all number types)
  - `string` (includes backticks\template literals)
  - `boolean` (NOT including `truthy` and `falsy`)
  - `object` (complete later)
  - `Array` (complete later)
  - `Tuple` (complete later)
  - `Enum` (complete later)
  - `any` (complete later)
  - `unknown` (complete later)
  - `never` (complete later)

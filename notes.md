# Understanding Typescript

## General

### Intro

- This project is based on the Udemy course `Understanding Typescript`

- `Typescript` is never executed directly. Only `Javascript` is executed, so
  `Typescript` must be compiled to `Javascript` to be executed

- The console command to compile `Typescript` to `Javascript` is `tsc`. For
  example:

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

- `lite-server` is a basic npm package for developing TS projects. It features
  automatic reloading of the browser when a file is changed
